This is a simple snake game with connect function.
But it didn't deal with all online game problem, so it may work not correctly.

Already know below problem:
* When player create new game, and exit web page, the game didn't destory directly ( XHR-Polling problem, I host it on herku )
* Sometime, the game screen is empty.
* You may lose when player2 is collision you. (I guess it is alreay fix, but I can't sure.)
